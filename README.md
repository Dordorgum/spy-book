# SpyBook

This was created a part of a [CocoaHeads presentation](https://vimeo.com/85578380) I gave on using [Origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami/), a design prototyping toolkit for Quartz Composer.

In order to run this composition, you'll need to have the Origami patches installed first.  Details on how to do this are available on the [Origami project page](http://facebook.github.io/origami/).
